# qool-markdown-loop

## Welcome Dear Friend!  
* you are visiting the qoolixiloop markdown repository
* read on if you like to find out how you can profit from it
* enjoy!
* :sparkles:


### Why could you profit from this repository?
* because you want to write readme.md files on GitHub
  * but need some examples as inspiration 
* because you want to write wiki pages on GitHub
  * but don't know how to start
* because you want to write your code in Vim 
  * but you are missing an html preview (that's what your browser reads)
* found anything?
* :dizzy:


### How qoolixiloop intends to make his friends productive
* you will get all my readme and wiki markdown files
  * that should serve as an inspiration to get you going quickly
* you will get advice about the preview (grip)
  * therefore you don't need to read through the plugin description
* you will get some links to official references
  * so you don't have to scroll through googles 1.5 trillion hits
* like christmas!
* :sparkling_heart:
